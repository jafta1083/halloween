## ✅ Verification

To verify everything is working:

   ```bash
   ls -la pwa/icon-*.png  # Should show both 192 and 512 px files
   ```

2. **Analytics:**
   - Play a game round in Streamlit app
   - Check Google Analytics → Real-time → Events
   - Should see `game_start`, `answer_submitted`, `game_completed` events
